 Software Version Description

 for

 Tie::Layers - read and write files pipelined through a stack of subroutine layers

 Revision: A

 Version: 0.02

 Date: 2004/05/09

 Prepared for: General Public 

 Prepared by:  SoftwareDiamonds.com E<lt>support@SoftwareDiamonds.comE<gt>

 Copyright: copyright © 2003 Software Diamonds

 Classification: NONE

=head1 1.0 SCOPE

This paragraph identifies and provides an overview
of the released files.

=head2 1.1 Identification

This release,
identified in L<3.2|/3.2 Inventory of software contents>,
is a collection of Perl modules that
extend the capabilities of the Perl language.

=head2 1.2 System overview

The C<Tie::Layers> program module contains the tie file handle C<Tie::Layers>
package.
The C<Tie::Layers> package provides the ability to insert a stack of subroutines between
file subroutines C<print> and C<realine> and the underlying C<$file>.
The syntax of the subroutines of each layer of the readline stack and the print
stack must comply to the
the requirements described herein below.
This is necessary so that the C<Tie::Layers> C<READLINE> and C<PRINT> subroutines
know how to transfer the output from one layer to the input of another layer.
The stacks are setup by supplying options with a reference to
the subroutine for each layer in the print stack and the readline stack.
The C<Tie::Layers> are line orientated and do not support any character
file subrouintes. The C<getc>, C<read>, and C<write> file subroutines
are supported by the C<Tie::Layers> package. The seek routines are line
oriented in that the C<seek> and C<tell> subroutine positions are the line
in the underlying file and not the character position in the file.

=head2 1.3 Document overview.

This document releases Tie::Layers version 0.02
providing a description of the inventory, installation
instructions and other information necessary to
utilize and track this release.

=head1 3.0 VERSION DESCRIPTION

All file specifications in this SVD
use the Unix operating
system file specification.
